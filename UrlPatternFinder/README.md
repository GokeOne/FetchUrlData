# How to use

It is very easy to use this script, first we need a list of urls in which we want to find certain patterns.

The are two ways to use this script:

1. `./script.sh list_of_urls.txt`
2. `./script.sh` and then the script will ask us to put the archive with urls.

## How i can get a list of urls?

U can use [UrlChecker](https://github.com/GokeOne/UrlChecker) to fetch urls of a domain. UrlChecker will give you a list of active urls
